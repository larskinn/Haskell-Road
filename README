My solutions to the exercises in The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and Programming by Kees Doets & Jan van Eijck.

The solutions are written in literal Haskell, using LaTeX. The chapters can be compiled to pdf using lhs2TeX and pdflatex, e.g.
    
    lhs2TeX -o chapter01.tex chapter01.lhs && pdflatex chapter01.tex
